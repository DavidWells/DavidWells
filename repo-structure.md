# Repository Naming convention

My repos are (mostly) organized by the following prefixes:

* [scratch](#scratch-name) - Random experiments and testing
* [spike](#spike-name) - Quick experiments to evaluate specific tech
* [demo](#demo-name) - Small projects built for demonstration
* [prototype](#prototype-name) - Early versions of potential products
* [talk](#talk-name) - Conference and presentation materials
* [template](#template-name) - Starter code and boilerplates
* [tools](#tools-name) - Production-ready utility tools
* [site](#site-name) - Deployed website codebases

Full projects, libraries, or packages might named without these prefixes.

## `scratch-{name}`
- For random testing and experimental code
- Catch-all category for projects that don't fit elsewhere
- May evolve into other categories over time
- Less structured than spikes or prototypes
- Example: `scratch-testing-ideas` for miscellaneous experiments

## `spike-{name}`
- Quick experiments to test or learn something specific
- Used for evaluating new libraries, frameworks, or approaches
- Typically short-lived and exploratory
- Example: `spike-graphql` to test out a GraphQL implementation

## `demo-{name}`
- Built specifically to showcase or present something
- Used in presentations, sales meetings, or teaching contexts
- Focused on clarity and presentation
- Example: `demo-authentication` showing different auth methods

## `prototype-{name}`
- Early versions of potential products or features
- More comprehensive than demos but not production-ready
- Used to validate concepts and gather feedback
- Example: `prototype-dashboard` for testing a new dashboard design

## `talk-{name}`
- Contains materials for presentations or conference talks
- Includes slides, code examples, and demo materials
- Organized around a specific speaking engagement
- Example: `talk-react-performance-2024` for a conference talk

## `template-{name}`
- Starter code or boilerplate for new projects
- Contains common configurations and basic setup
- Used as a foundation for creating new repositories
- Example: `template-react-app` for starting new React projects

## `tools-{name}`
- Internal or deployed tools that provide actual utility
- Production-quality code that solves specific problems
- Maintained and used regularly
- Example: `tools-log-analyzer` for a logging analysis tool

## `site-{name}`
- Production websites and apps that are deployed and maintained
- Contains complete website codebases
- Includes both frontend and associated backend code
- Example: `site-company-blog` for a deployed company blog
